##Introduction:
As said earlier **bot-bot** is an native android automation tool. One of the components of the **bot-bot** is the **recorder**.

**Recorder** is used to record user actions on the android app under test and send these actions to the **bot-bot server**.

Following are the available configuration:

- SERVER_PORT -> Port on which the server is running. Default is 8080.
- SESSION_NAME -> Session name that the recroder uses to create the session on the server.
- SERVER_NAME -> Server name . Used in case the server is deployed on a servelet container server like Apache,Jboss. Default its not set and assumes that the user is using the standalone mode of the server.
